# HorrorHouse (Name Subject to change)
A thriller FPS mystery game that lets the player solve puzzles for him to escape the house.  There will be ghosts that will try to kill him. In order for him to fight the ghosts, he must capture them by "taking thier picture". This game is probably like fatal frame though I haven't played it yet.

  * Player must escape the castle to finish the game
